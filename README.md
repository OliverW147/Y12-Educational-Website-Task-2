Designer's Statement:

My project aimed to address a problem in online learning. As topics become more complex in later years of school, many educational websites become less interactive and rely on static formats to teach content. While such formats can still prove to be valuable, they require high levels of initiative and motivation from the learner. My project innovatively addresses this issue by incorporating interactive elements into online physics and maths resources to engage users, provide feedback, and track progress.
One main innovation of this project is the use of different forms of interactive elements as opposed to relying on one repetitive format. In addition to resources, the website contains quizzes and an accounts system to facilitate progress tracking and feedback.
The website is object-oriented and developed using the Flask framework in Python. It is structured around the User Class, which encapsulates progress and is associated with quizzes and resources. SQL Alchemy is effectively utilised as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to map these classes to database tables. This approach allows objects to persist beyond the website’s runtime. It also supports future updates outside of the current scope.
Upon landing on the homepage, a hero section and call-to-action button entices users to register an account and log in. A dashboard allows for access to resources related to mathematics and physics. The specific topics currently covered by the website are algebra, Newton’s laws, and simultaneous equations.
Interactive elements in the resources include practice questions that users can attempt. Once a topic has been covered, the user has the option to take quizzes on said topic. Quiz results are displayed in a progress section on the dashboard. The question types integrated into the resources are different for each resource. This innovative approach is arguably more effective than some standard methods.
During development, I faced multiple challenges related to handling data in resources and quizzes. To solve these, I used innovative JavaScript functions in the HTML files that leverage DOM manipulation to provide functionalities for different question types.
Feedback from early testing shed light on improvements like better link colour contrast, more user-friendly authentication messages, cleaner-looking buttons, and the addition of back buttons. While these were effectively implemented, further improvements such as the use of additional interactive content like images and videos, along with features like a friends and leveling system, could further prove beneficial to users.
Overall, the platform effectively combines interactivity, feedback, and progress tracking, creating an engaging learning platform for topics in physics and mathematics. By addressing the limitations of static content, the website provides an innovative solution that motivates learners. With further development, I believe it has the potential to become a strong alternative to static learning methods.
